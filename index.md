# Finding unique and curated art can be hard. It doesn't have to be. 

![pexels-daria-shevtsova-3597326](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24867764/96948211-f18c7d00-1499-11eb-9027-9fed21ab8711.jpg)

## Meet Arthur, an ML driven tool that will discover art tailored to your taste, with only a few clicks.

If you want to buy a specific Picasso print, stop reading and go to Art.com or Amazon, marketplaces have hundreds of thousands of prints. 
- If you want something particular, these will likely have it
- If you don’t, they can be overwhelming. 

**What should I do?**
Go to most popular? → No, I want to get something more personalized, something that represents my own taste and style
Go to “Editor’s Pick” or “Featured”? → No, too broad. Sometimes I'll find something interesting, but most of the time I don't.

**Currently, there's no artwork browsing experience that is smart, personalized, and simple.**

## What's the solution? 
We'll show you 8 different pairs of artwork. Each time, you click which one you like better. Our ML model will then suggest a few pieces you might like!
