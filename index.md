If you want to buy a specific Picasso print, stop reading and go to Art.com or Amazon. These marketplaces have hundreds of thousands of prints. If you want something particular, these will likely have it. The downside is that if you don’t, they’re overwhelming and confusing. What should I do?

- Go to most popular? → No, I want to get something more personalized, something that represents my own taste and style
- Go to “New” or “Editor’s Pick” or “Featured”? → No, too general. The chance that the “Editor’s Pick” of a certain obscure artist is well aligned with what I want is too low. 

**Currently, there's no artwork browsing experience that is smart, personalized, and simple.**

## What's the solution?
