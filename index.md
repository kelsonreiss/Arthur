# Welcome to Arthur, the AI Art Curator

## Finding unique and curated art can be hard. It doesn't have to be. 

![pexels-daria-shevtsova-3597326](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24867764/96948211-f18c7d00-1499-11eb-9027-9fed21ab8711.jpg)


If you want a specific Picasso print, stop reading and go to Art.com or Amazon. 

If not, these marketplaces with 200,000+ pieces can be **overwhelming.**

**What should I do?**
Most popular? → No, I want to get something more personalized.
“Editor’s Pick” or “Featured”? → No, too broad. Sometimes I'll find a hit, but most of the time I don't.


**Currently, there's no artwork browsing experience that is smart, personalized, and simple.**

## Meet Arthur. 
We'll show you 8 different pairs of artwork. Each time, you click which one you like better. Our machine learning model will then suggest a few pieces you might like!
